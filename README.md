## 📂 Project Structure

- **`app.py`**: Main application script built using Streamlit.
- **`Gov schemes.csv`**: Dataset containing details of various government schemes.
- **`tfidf_matrix.pkl` & `vectorizer (3).pkl`**: Pre-trained models for text vectorization and similarity computation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all Python dependencies.
- **`setup.sh`**: Shell script for setting up the environment.
- **`.devcontainer/`**: Configuration files for development container setup.
- **`fonts/`**: Directory containing font files used in the application.

## 🚀 Getting Started

## 🛠️ Features

- **Natural Language Querying**: Users can input queries in plain language to find relevant government schemes.
- **Efficient Matching**: Utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to match user queries with scheme descriptions.
- **Hybrid Recommendation Logic**: Combines TF-IDF, bigrams, lemmatization, and dimensionality reduction (SVD) for more accurate matches.
- **Interactive UI**: Built using Streamlit, offering a clean and responsive user interface.
- **PDF Report Generation**: Generates downloadable PDF reports of the recommended schemes.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple to deploy on Streamlit Cloud or any Python-compatible hosting.

## 📊 Dataset description
The system uses a curated CSV dataset (`Gov schemes.csv`) that contains comprehensive information about various Indian government schemes. Each record in the dataset includes:

- **Scheme Name**
- **Description**
- **Eligibility Criteria**
- **Target Audience**
- **Sector**
- **Link to Apply / Official Website**

This data is used to match user queries using natural language processing techniques.
